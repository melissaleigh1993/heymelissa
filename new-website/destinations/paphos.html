    <h2>Paphos, Cyprus</h2>
    <p>
      It started out with me wanting to get away for my birthday, and after chatting with a friend about traveling, I decided to check out if any airlines were having a New Year's sale since it was so close to my birthday. I was in luck!
      Ryan Air had flights for as little as 5 Euro! I played around with the dates and after a bit hesitation (I love planning things out and am not usually this spontaneous) I bought a roundtrip flight to Paphos, Cyprus for 5 days at the end of January for 14 Euro total.
      I was in such disbelief I could book a flight so cheap.
      Sure, it was hand luggage only, but a challenge to travel light is always in favor.
      I've done carry on only before, twice now, but it's still a struggle to take as little as possible.
      I'm getting better at it, and slowly but surely I'll get the hang of it.
      This was also my second trip traveling solo.
      Most people when they hear I'm going by myself, they can't believe I'd be so brave to do something like that.
      I love it.
      It's so freeing and both times I've gone by myself I never actually felt alone.

    <h3>Day 1 - Paphos</h3>
    <p>
      My first full day in Paphos was a rocky one.
      I got in late the night before, but luckily my "shared taxi" that I booked through the airline ended up being a private cab.
      Took me directly to my hotel and only for 11 Euro!
      It was pouring out rain and I was starving so I checked what was open nearby to grab something quick to eat.
      It was 11pm on a Saturday night but everywhere I looked was dark and closed up for the night.
      I wandered around maybe 15 minutes before just heading back to my hotel and just turning in for the night.
      Things will be open tomorrow for sure.
      First thing in the morning I headed out and it's still raining so I ducked into the first cafe that was open.
      They were super nice to me there and I was able to stay til the rain let up maybe an hour or so later.
      The cafe was right on the water so once the sun came out it was beautiful.
      After breakfast I wandered around the harbor and Paphos Castle.
      I did an impromptu photo shoot, trying out my new tripod and got some amazing shots.
      Continuing my walk on the boardwalk, I saw some pretty incredible tidepools and views of the northen part of Paphos.
      After walking about 2 km I decided to circle back and walk the main road back to the harbor.
      Along the way I stumbled upon a herd of goats who were super friendly.
      A couple kids came up to me and as much as I wanted to pet them, I knew their mama was around and didn't want to start trouble.
      I had originally thought they were someone's animals, but later learned that wild goats roam freely around the island.

<h3>Day 2 - Paphos</h3>
    <p>
      Trekking out from Paphos Harbor, I headed up to Old Paphos to check out the market and do a bit of wandering around, as I do best.
      I saw on AirBnB Experiences (check it out if you're going someplace new - I found so many interesting activities!) that I could do a pottery class for 5 Euro, so I figure why not?
      Should be a fun experience and will make a better souvenir than just buying the same old cheap crap I usually buy.
      The store was called <a href="https://www.theplacecyprus.com/" target="blank">The Place</a> and I highly recommend to check it out if visitng Paphos.
      They do other art classes, such as wood burning, oil paining, and glass cutting.
      There was also local specialties, like olives, spices, wine, and fruit spreads.
      Not learning from the pottery incident at camp at age 13, I should've realized to cut my nails before going on this trip.
      I have long nails, which do not mix well with delicate clay.
      I tried to make do, but my nails kept cutting the clay while I was trying to mold it.
      In the end, I was told that what I made wouldn't be ready in time before I left, so they gave me a pot that the potter Costas (who gave me the lesson) made himself and they wrapped it up nicely for me to take home.

<h3>Day 3 - Lefkara and Nicosia</h3>
<p>
  Following a good experience I had in Naxos, I decided to check out some day tours in Cyprus.
  It seems that most travel agencies all run the same tours, but the prices can vary.
  I did two full day tours booked through <a href="https://www.poseidonostravel.com/" target="blank">Poseidonos Travel</a> and to be honest I felt like I really got my money's worth.
  I was able to book both tours through Whatsapp and I paid in person each day.
  This tour cost 20 Euro and the second tour cost 30.
  For around 9 hours each I think that's pretty good.
  I saw some places a bit cheaper afterwards but I'm not too upset.
  The tour began with a stop in Lefkara, a village close to Larnaca where they are known for making handmade linens, jewelry, silver, and other items.
  The village was pretty much deserted since it was dead of winter, and most of the shops were closed until the spring when the tourists come back.
  There were a few stores still open and a cafe with a couple locals sitting, drinking coffee, and shooting the breeze.
